- **b.**
  
Work: W(n) = W(n-1) + 1
Span: S(n) = S(n-1) + 1

Big O solution is O(n) for both


- **d.**

  Scan example from class, Work: W(n) = W(n/2) + n.   therefore, work is O(n)
  Span is S(n) = S(n/2) + 1, so span is O(log(n))




- **f.**

W = W(n/2) + 1
Big O is O(n)

S = S(n/2) + 1
Big O is O(lgn)
